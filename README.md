Scripts for building books

Books should be their own repository. 
The main repo has the template for the book; 
including images, CSS, and such.  
The matching "bookname.wiki" repo has the actual
text.  Both should be checked out, to build the book.

This also depends on an external git submodule:

```git submodule add https://github.com/iamcal/emoji-data.git```
